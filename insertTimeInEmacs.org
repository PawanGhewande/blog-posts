#+DESCRIPTION: how to insert time-stamp string into a file from GNU/Emacs
#+TITLE: Insert time-stamp from GNU/Emacs

Often you need to insert a /time-stamp/ within a file while working in
GNU/Emacs. One way of doing it is to type
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
C-u C-! date
#+END_SRC

which will print a string something like 
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
Sun Feb 24 00:11:59 IST 2013
#+END_SRC

What if you want to print a formatted time string ? and to bind that
action with specific key strokes to use within GNU/Emacs ?

Open your *~/.emacs* file and add following code to it.
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
(defun insert-current-time()
  ''insert the current time''
  (interactive ''*'')
  (insert (format-time-string ''%l.%M %p''))
  )

(global-set-key ''\C-x\C-t'' 'insert-current-time)
#+END_SRC

reload *~/.emacs* file using
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
M-x eval-buffer
#+END_SRC

now you can print the time any where within a file by typing
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
C-x C-t
#+END_SRC
or by using the function =insert-current-time=

Note that the above code will print the time as
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
12.41 AM
#+END_SRC

if you want to print a entire time-stamp, replace line starting with
=(insert ....= from above code snippet with
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(insert (current-time-string))
#+END_SRC
