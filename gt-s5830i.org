* Upgrade Samsung GT-s5830i from 2.3 to 4.1(with JellyBlast ROM)

  /Warning/: Rooting can void your phone's warranty. Please follow the
  steps at your own risk. You must really be a brave heart to root and
  upgrade you ROM. Follow the steps exactly, unable to do so can brick
  your phone and make it unusable(for life). Headphones are not
  detected so you need to install 'SoundAbout' from Google play. You
  need to buy licensed version of 'SoundAbout' to enable calling using
  headphones

** Before you proceed
*** Make backup
**** Sync
    - Take backup of your contacts/SMS etc.
    - Or sync to your Google account.

     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       Select install update from sd
     #+END_SRC sh

     and select =update.zip= file
     
     /Note/: Use =Vol-UP=, =Vol-DOWN= keys to move up/down

   - Select 

     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       Reboot phone
     #+END_SRC sh

   - By now your phone should be rooted and =SuperUser= icon will
     appear in your application menu.

** Make backup-2
   - Now its a good time to backup of your data 
   - CWM(/ClockWorkMod ROM Manager/) can backup the entire ROM.
   - /Titanium Backup/ can be used to backup apps and other data

*** Titanium Backup(requires rooting)
    - Backup using Titanium Backup. It can backup data as well as
       apps

*** Using CWM(requires rooting)
    - Select 

      #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       Select install update from sd
      #+END_SRC sh

    - and select =ClockWorkRec5830i.zip=

    - You are now inside CWM recovery menu.
      
    - Now select =backup and restore= and select =backup=.

    - This will backup you existing ROM along with data.
      
    - CWM will save the backup in you SDcard under =ClockworkMod=
      directory

      [[./gt-s5830i-images/cwm_backup.jpg]]

** Install 4.1(JellyBlast v3.0.3)
   
   - I assume you have made a backup of your data and ROM and you are
     still inside CWM recovery menu.
   - Go back to default Samsung recovery menu by pressing =POWER=
     button
   - Select =wipe data/reset=
   - Again go to CWM recovery menu by selecting =install zip from sd=
     -> =ClockWorkRec5830i.zip=

   - Now select =wipe data/factory reset= and say =yes= (Use UP/DOWN
     volume key)
      
   - Also do the same by selecting =wipe cache partition=

   - Also visit =advanced= menu and select =wipe dalvik cache=

   - Now come back to main menu of CWM and select =apply update from
     sdcard=

   - and choose =jellyblastv3.0.3_ported_for_s5830i.zip= file.

   - Wait for some time till the ROM is installed and select =reboot
     system now=

     #+CAPTION:    JellyBlast 3.0.3 install complete
     #+LABEL:      fig:update
     #+ATTR_LaTeX: width=5cm,angle=0
     
     [[./gt-s5830i-images/install-complete.jpg]]

   - I recommend to backup your freshly installed ROM using *CWM*.

** Bug fix
   - To fix the headset issue install 'SoundAbout' app from Google
     play store.
   - *Do not* install external =gapps= over this ROM.
