#+DESCRIPTION :Add swap to ZTE Blade without using swapper2
#+TITLE: Add swap on ZTE Blade without swapper2

Idea Blade/ZTE Blade comes with 167 MB usable memory. Their is no way
you can install CyanogenMod9/10 in such a low RAM. However I took a
chance and installed CM9 and it slogs like hell. Swapper2 can be used
to add swap, but it adds another memory and space
constraint. [[http://androidforums.com/boost-mobile-warp-all-things-root/610449-ram-swapping-without-swapper2.html][drewhill77]] came up with an excellent way to add swap
without installing swapper2. This a simple way swap is added in
typical UNIX system.

#+HTML: <!--more-->

In this post I will follow /drewhill77's/ steps but I will confine it
to ZTE Blade. I assume CyanogenMod9 is pre-installed on the device. A
swap-file will be created on SD-card instead of using a
partition. Unlike /swapper2/ which limits swap-file size to 256MB,
this file-size can be extended as long as size of the SD-card
permits. Following procedure may also work for other devices, provided
they are rooted. User should be familiar with shell commands and
should be able to do some system level jobs.

/drewhill77/ have used terminal manager to execute all commands but I
prefer /adb/ over it. Usage of [[http://developer.android.com/tools/help/adb.html][adb]] is beyond the scope of this
post. After you enter the device shell using *adb* using 

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  adb shell
#+END_SRC sh

** Change to root
   First and foremost thing is to have root access to the device. In
   CyanogenMod, a pre-installed /SuperUser/ app with grant root access
   to all applications as well as to file-system.
   
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     su
   #+END_SRC sh
   
   will give root access. The prompt will change from =$= to =#=.
     
** Create a swap-file

   Create a swap-file with the name =swapfile.swp= on SD-card.
   
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     dd if=/dev/zero of=/mnt/sdcard/swapfile.swp bs=1048576 count=256
   #+END_SRC sh

   /count/ is the size of swapfile in MB. I prefer 256 MB.

** Make swap and turn it on.

   Once swapfile is created, which should not take more than a couple
   of minutes. Convert it into swapfile(previously it was just a bunch
   of zero's). And finally inform system to use it as a swap file or
   add it to existing swap if is already exist.
   
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     mkswap /mnt/sdcard/swapfile.swp
     swapon /mnt/sdcard/swapfile.swp
   #+END_SRC sh

   Once swap is added, its time to confirm it using =free= command.

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     free -m
   #+END_SRC sh

   | total |     used |   free | shared | buffers |     |
   | Mem:  |   171296 | 165552 |   5744 |       0 | 104 |
   | -/+   | buffers: | 165448 |   5848 |         |     |
   | Swap: |   262136 | 114888 | 147248 |         |     |

   The swap will be added as seen in /Swap/ column.

** Swappiness

   Now the swap is added and it is in use but the kernel will not use
   it at the fullest if /swappiness/ is not set properly. /Swappiness/
   decides how aggressively you want the kernel to use swap. It's
   value ranges from 0 to 100. The lower value means kernel will try
   to avoid using swap whereas for higher value it will use swap as
   much as possible. For most systems, the default value is set
   to 60. One can check the value of swappiness by reading the file
   =/proc/sys/vm/swappiness=
   
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness
   #+END_SRC sh

   Change the value using
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     echo 70 /proc/sys/vm/swappiness
   #+END_SRC sh

   or using
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     sysctl -w vm.swappiness=70
   #+END_SRC sh
   
   Go ahead and change swappiness from 60 to 100.
   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
     echo 100 /proc/sys/vm/swappiness
   #+END_SRC sh
   
   and verify the value from the file =swappiness=.

** Make all the changes persistent 
 
   Now that the swap is been created & added to the system and the
   swappiness is set, it's time to make all the changes persistent on
   every boot. The swapfile on the SD-card will remain as it is, but
   =swapon= should be run and desired value of swappiness is to be
   set. Some shell scripts should do these jobs. /drewhill77/ has
   already uploaded shell scripts for variety of purpose.

*** swapon

    As swapfile should be added to system after a boot, it is better
    to add this command to system's init. The best place is the
    =/data/local/userinit.d/= directory. If you scan the content of
    =/etc/init.d/90userinit= file, it looks for user init files under
    the directory =/data/local/userinit.d/=. Create the directory if
    it does not exist.

    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      mkdir -p /data/local/userinit.d
    #+END_SRC sh

    and add the shell script =99swapon= with below lines.
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      #!/system/bin/sh
      sleep 75
      swapon /mnt/sdcard/swapfile.swp
      sysctl -p
    #+END_SRC sh
    
    Line 1 is the /shebang/ line which identifies the file as a shell
    script.

    Line 2 is the =sleep= command with sleep interval of 75 seconds
    before it executes line 3 which actually adds swap. SD-card is
    always mounted at the end. As a result it is safe to add swap with
    some intervals after system boots. Make the file executable.

    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      chmod +x /data/local/userinit.d/99swapon
    #+END_SRC sh

*** swappiness
    
    The second thing is to set default /swappiness/ value. It can be
    done from =/etc/sysctl.conf= file. =/etc= is write protected and
    it has to be remounted as writable before creating a file.

    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      busybox mount -o remount,rw /system
    #+END_SRC sh

    and add below line in the file =/etc/sysctl.conf=. Create a new
    file if does not exist.
    #+BEGIN_SRC sh
      vm.swappiness=100
    #+END_SRC sh

Reboot the phone and you should have swap added with swappiness
of 100. Read last section of [[http://androidforums.com/boost-mobile-warp-all-things-root/610449-ram-swapping-without-swapper2.html][drewhill77]] post for a brief note on
swapping.
